Simple Cross Section Calculator
===============================

This program uses VEGAS to calculate the leading order cross section of 
the process u u~ -> mu+ mu- where the quarks are constituents of the proton.
The matrix element is generated with MadGraph and depends on ALOHA for the
complex mass scheme.
By default a Breit-Wigner mapping is used but also a simple integration is
available (see main.cpp).

Usage
-----
 mpirun -np 2 ./xsec

Dependencies
------------
- OpenMPI for VEGAS
- ALOHA functions for the matrix element (generated by MadGraph)
- LHAPDF
